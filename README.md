### Hello visitor, I'm Ritik 👋

I'm a curious and enthusiastic Computer Science major @ UBC, with a boundless passion for computing and an entrepreneurial streak. When I am not coding I also enjoy unraveling the mysteries of psychology 🧠, physics ⚛️, and philosophy 💭 in my free time. I thrive in environments where I can absorb new knowledge, challenge my understanding, and apply my learnings in creative ways.
